Heaps are basically trees with rules

Max heap parent is greater than all of it's children

Min heap parent is less than all of it's children

Rather than nodes, heaps are represented in terms of lists, in Java heap is implemented via PriorityQueue
 - Java provides a PriorityQueue class, which is a Min-Heap by default.
